## Objectives

The goal of this repository is to help you:
1. Understand the basics of Pandas, including DataFrames and Series.
2. Learn how to manipulate, clean, and analyze datasets.
3. Practice real-world data analysis tasks using provided datasets.
4. Gain confidence in using Pandas for data science and machine learning workflows.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. `tuto_pandas.ipynb`
- A beginner-friendly tutorial covering:
  - Loading datasets with Pandas.
  - Exploring and summarizing data.
  - Basic data manipulation (filtering, sorting, grouping, etc.).
  - Handling missing data.

### 2. `analyse.ipynb`
- A notebook focused on practical data analysis tasks, such as:
  - Merging and joining datasets.
  - Advanced filtering and transformations.
  - Visualizing data insights.

### 3. `main_solo.ipynb`
- A solo practice notebook with exercises and challenges to test your Pandas skills. Ideal for self-assessment after completing the tutorial.

## Datasets

The repository includes the following datasets for practice:
- **`castorama_categories.csv`**: Contains information about product categories.
- **`castorama_products.csv`**: Includes details about products from Castorama.
- **`quincaillerie_products.csv`**: A dataset focused on quincaillerie (hardware) products.

These datasets are used in the notebooks to demonstrate real-world data manipulation and analysis scenarios.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks, you need the following Python libraries installed. The `requirement.txt` file lists all dependencies:

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
jupyter
```

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
